                First and foremost; I am a father to a beautiful, strong-willed, independant daughter. I am a husband to a beautiful, creative and understanding wife, both of whom gracefully accept my enthusuasm for our community, technology and my often being overly analytical.

                I aspire to always be impactful, to give my time to improve the lives of those around me.

                I am a Solutions Architect and have worked in the IT field for the last decade. I am always looking to see where my skillsets can benefit us even here in rural Minnesota. Prior to moving to Minnesota, I was an instructor and member of New Braunfles CERT or Community Emergency Response Team. 
                C.E.R.T being an organization who teaches disaster preparedness and actively helps offset the burden placed on our first responders in the event of an emergency. I was also a founding member and volunteer for Texas Hill Country Search and Rescue.
